# LSTM-TF2

LSTM is the really greastest breakthrough in the AI histtory. Its referral citations overpass all the other papers including 
AlexNet, InceptionNet or ResNet. Especially the new trend is that the CNN models are merging with time sequence models such 
as RNN. NASNet is a typical example. LSTM will be merging with the CNN models to prepel the deep learning in the future. 

Make the necessary changes to adapt to the environment of TensorFlow 2.3, Keras 2.4.3, CUDA Toolkit 11.0, cuDNN 8.0.1 and CUDA 
450.57. In addition, write the new lines of code to replace the deprecated code. I would like to take the opportunity to thank 
the LSTM creators, Giancario Zaccone, jaungiers, munozalexander for their precious contributions.
