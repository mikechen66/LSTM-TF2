Notes:

The two of the data files are zipped due to the limitation
of the limitations of big file at Github. The four data files
are listed as follows. 

1. funamentals.csv
2. prices.csv (prices.zip)
3. prices-split-adjusted.csv(prices-split-adjusted)
4. securities.csv

Please upzip the two zipped files for running the script 
of either predict_apple.py or predict_apple.ipynb.
