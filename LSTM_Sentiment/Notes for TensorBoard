Notes:

Please run the following command to run the TensorBoard in either the Linux Terminal or
the jupytern notebook. Please rember to change the sample path to your own path. 

Option A: Linux Terminal 

1. Enter the current directory.
After excuting the script of predict.py, users can input the following command to initiate
the TensorBoard.

$ tensorboard --logdir /home/mike/Documents/keras_lstm/LSTM_Sentiment/logs

Serving TensorBoard on localhost; to expose to the network, use a proxy or pass --bind_all
TensorBoard 2.2.1 at http://localhost:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

2. Run the TensorBoard

Copy the weblink at your browser

http://localhost:6006/

And then the TensorBoard will show both the scalar and the graph 


Option B: Jupyter Notebook

# 1.Load the TensorBoard notebook extension
%load_ext tensorboard

# 2.Show the scalars and the graph
%tensorboard --logdir='/home/mic/Documents/keras_lstm/LSTM_Sentiment/logs'
